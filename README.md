# ANLY 502 - Hello World!

Hi!

Shuyang here, I'm a backend developer. Fan of high performance computing, machine learning, and math/problem solving in general. My favorite programming language (as of May 2021) is Rust, love its compile-time memory and thread safety features!

If you want to collaborate on a project, feel free to shoot me an [email](shuyangsun10@gmail.com)!
